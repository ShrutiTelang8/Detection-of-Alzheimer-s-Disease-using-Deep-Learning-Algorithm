# Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Deep Learning
Alzheimer’s disease is a ”progressive” disease. It is a neurological disorder that causes memory loss and dementia. It is mainly observed in elderly individuals over the age of 60. It causes brain cells to die and spread the damage across the brain. Its symptoms usually start slowly and are mild. There are many ways to diagnose and detect it. MRI scans, MMSE (mini-mental state exams) expressed in terms of CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) standards are a few. Though the above methods help in predicting the disease accurately, identifying distinctions between Alzheimer’s brain and normal brain in elderly individuals (over the age of 75) is diﬃcult. This is because they share similar brain patterns and image intensities. 

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's makes individuals eligible for a wider variety of clinical trials. The objective of this project is to develop a system for detecting Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using the methodology of Deep Learning. This is to accomplish the aim of reducing human (Doctor) eﬀorts for detecting the disease by developing a reliable system. 

 Data set was obtained from ADNI ( Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). 
 
 Convolutional Neural Networks sequential model was used in this project.
