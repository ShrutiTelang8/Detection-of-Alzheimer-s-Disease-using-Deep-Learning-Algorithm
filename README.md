# Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Deep Learning
Alzheimer’s disease is a ”progressive” disease. It is a neurological disorder that causes memory loss and dementia. It is mainly observed in elderly individuals over the age of 60. The disease is generally caused due to the death of brain cells but can also be due to concussions or traumatic brain injuries. It causes brain cells to die and spread the damage across the brain. Its symptoms usually start slowly and are mild. In the later stages, a person who has Alzheimer’s is no longer able to communicate and depends entirely on his/her family or friends. There are many ways to diagnose and detect it. MRI scans, MMSE (mini-mental state exams) expressed in terms of CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating) standards are a few. Though the above methods help in predicting the disease accurately, identifying distinctions between Alzheimer’s brain and normal brain in elderly individuals (over the age of 75) is diﬃcult. This is because they share similar brain patterns and image intensities.
